# OncoReGen: A Reinforcement-Guided GPT Pipeline for Precision Oncology and EGFR Inhibitor Discovery
Generating new drug-like molecules is a complex and time-consuming process, often requiring the assessment of thousands of compounds. Conventional trial-and-error approaches are expensive and uncertain, underscoring the need for more intelligent generative methods. Recent research has investigated deep learning and reinforcement learning (RL) for molecular generation, with models such as ReLeaSE, REINVENT, and ChemGPT demonstrating potential. However, few methods have directly utilized RL with pretrained chemical language models to design EGFR-specific inhibitors. We introduce a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework for EGFR-specific drug design, combining a Transformer-based chemical language model (cMolGPT), a property predictor (XGBoost), and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Using the ChEMBL203 dataset, the model was directed to produce molecules with high predicted pIC50 values through a tailored reward function. Experimental results indicate that the XGBoost model achieved robust predictive performance (R2 = 0.7475, MAE = 0.5111), effectively guiding the RL process. The generated molecules exhibited high predicted activity, favorable lipophilicity, and a diverse range of molecular weights, suggesting strong drug-likeness and target specificity. These findings validate the effectiveness of our framework in producing valid, potent, and target-specific molecules.
